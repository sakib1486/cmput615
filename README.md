# cmput615

This repository consists of the project work done for _CMPUT615: 3D Modelling and Computer Vision_ as part of completion of the course in the _Winter 2022_ semester in the University of Alberta.

# Author

The coursework is solely done by _Sakib Hasan (ID#1671531, sakib2@ualberta.ca)_


# Dataset

The necessary data for both of the experimentation are available at [G-Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZZK9vt-lv--_DdphGFBn94Pet-IihTM8?usp=sharing). Because of size issue, there is only a small portion of data uploaded in the repository. Please download necessary data required.

# Platform Used

The platform I used for the experimentation is [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

# ROI Detection

The ROI detection model's code is [this](cmput615_detectron2.ipynb). The notebook is designed for Google Colab. Please avail all the data required for training and testing before you carry out the experiments.

# ROI Mask Extraction

Similarly, the ROI  mask extraction is done on Google Colab as well. The code file is [here](scoliosis.ipynb). The necessary data for this experimentation is available in the aforementioned G-Drive. Because of the minimum size concern, I could not integrate the data in the repository.
